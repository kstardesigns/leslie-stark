All updates should be caught up now! Bummer you had to take the Echo house off the market and lower the price :( but hopefully you can enjoy continuing to live there! A lot of these pictures are super nice, it makes me want to buy one.

Also that's a super nice testimonial from the sweet old lady! :)

Thanks for providing all the info I needed.

A couple notes:
- since the last pic in the Thunder Pass house was vertical, I had to crop it to fit the little slideshow I made.. let me know if it's okay.
- same thing with the stairs pic in the Vista Loop house. I attached a screenshot of what it'd look like if I didn't crop it. I can also make it uncropped and smaller, if you want, it would be pretty tiny though.
