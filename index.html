        <h1>Buying</h1>
        <p><em>Congratulations! You are on the first step of buying a home!</em></p>
        <p>Nothing beats the feeling of waking up to the first day in a new home. Looking around the room you realize, that just a few months ago this was still a dream, but now these walls, doors and windows all belong to you. <!-- <span class="buyingexpand">Expand +</span> --> </p>
        <!-- <div class="buyingmore"> -->
            <p>However, the process to get to this point can sometimes be intimidating and confusing. As an experienced real estate agent, I am here to guide you through the entire process from selecting the right home, to closing at the right price. I will help you shop for the best rates, terms and can even suggest mortgage lenders.</p>
            <p><strong>Here are some things to consider before purchasing a home:</strong></p>
            <h2>Check your credit</h2>
            <p>Get copies of your credit report.  If need be, clean it up.  Remember, the higher your credit score, the better your loan interest rate.</p>
            <h2>Price Range</h2>
            <p>Determine your price range before you consider the areas you would like to live, so you can look at homes only in your budget.</p>
            <h2>Find a lender</h2>
            <p>Most people have to take out a loan to buy a home, and you want to be prepared to make a purchase offer as soon as you find a home you're interested in.  So, you want to make sure that you are approved for a loan before you look at homes.  If you need help finding a lender, I can recommend trusted lenders in your area.</p>
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>The details count when looking for the perfect home.  If you have children, you will want to consider the school districts in the area.  Do you want more bedrooms or bathrooms?  Would you prefer a newer or older home?  These are all things to keep in mind when looking for your new home.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Found your home?</li>
              <li>When you find the home you want to buy, I'm ready to prepare a written offer.  Since I'm familiar with market value, I'll help you arrive at a price that gives your offer the best chance of being accepted.</li>
              <li>Have a Backup Home</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Once Your Offer is Accepted</h2>
            <p>After your offer is accepted, escrow will be opened with the title company and the inspection period will begin. After inspection you will have the opportunity to request repairs and address other concerns in an inspection notice to the seller. The next step is to verify the terms and conditions of your loan and also verify all needed cash funds are in place for any down payment. You will have the opportunity to review all closing papers prior to signing. My job is to be there with you every step of the way.</p>
            <h2>Moving time</h2>
            <p>Now that you've obtained your home the next step is moving arrangements. If you plan on hiring a professional mover, schedule accordingly. I can also suggest reputable companies. Don't forget to submit a change of address form and contact the local utility companies.</p>

      <h1 class="selling">Selling</h1>
        <p><strong>Why do I need a Realtor?</strong></p>
        <p>This is a question I hear from people trying to sell their home every day.</p>
        <p>I can help you get your home sold at the best price possible, in the right time frame by marketing your home locally and online, and by making myself available to interested buyers whenever they call. Working with a real estate agent also adds objectivity to the inherently emotional transaction that is selling your home. <!-- <span class="sellingexpand">Expand +</span> --></p>
        <!-- <div class="sellingmore"> -->

          <p><strong>Before Your Home Is Listed</strong></p>
            <p>It's important to have your home in good showing condition before buyers start going through it. Here are some steps to take:</p>
            <h2>Spot Paint</h2>
            <p>Touch up interior and exterior paint as needed.</p>
            <h2>Update Carpet</h2>
            <p>Install new carpeting and flooring if it appears worn or dated.</p>
            <h2>Curb Appeal</h2>
            <p>Make sure the front is clean and spruced up – curb appeal will create a favorable first impression.</p>
            <h2>Extra Cleaning</h2>
            <p>Keep the interior clean, uncluttered and odor-free. Eliminate evidence of pets.</p>
            <h2>Minimize You to Maximize Them</h2>
            <p>Minimize personal items such as family photos. You want buyers to see themselves living in the home</p>
            <h2>Start Packing</h2>
            <p>Consider putting excess furniture and belongings in storage. Now's the time to clean out the garage and basement and sell, give away or throw away items you don't need any more.</p>
            <h2>Find Potential Problems Early</h2>
            <p>Consider having a pre-listing inspection performed. Buyers will be hiring professional inspectors; here's your chance to address problems in advance.</p>
            <h2>Professional Stager</h2>
            <p>Consider engaging a professional stager to give your home the right emotional appeal.</p>

      <blockquote>I worked with Leslie for approximately 1 ½ years looking at properties in numerous communities all over the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Leslie was always there to set up appointments and help us navigate our way through the home buying experience.  She worked tirelessly with us to make sure we found the place that fit our architectural style and pricing in the luxury  home market.  She helped to make the whole process what it should be..  which is an enjoyable experience until you find the property that says this is home!

      <blockquote>Leslie was professional at all times as well as super friendly and extremely helpful with the whole process. We are very new to selling a home in the AZ area and it can be a very confusing and painful process if you don't have the help of an experienced, calm, understanding realtor! Leslie excels in all these areas and we would not hesitate to recommend her for buying or selling a home! An absolute pleasure to work with her!

      <blockquote>It was wonderful working with Leslie! Selling my home took 4 attempts as buyers kept backing out. Leslie was always quick to respond and kept the process moving. All with a smile and a happy to help attitude! Leslie was also great to work with on my new home purchase. From viewing homes to working through the purchase process, Leslie has a fun approach and always made me feel as though I was her top priority!

      <blockquote>We were looking for either a house, or a lot where we could build. We looked and looked, and Leslie never once seemed to tire of showing us homes and lots. We almost had a deal with a seller on a home, but he balked at the last minute, through no fault of ours or Leslie's. Leslie didn't miss a beat, and she kept at it until we found a lot for us to build on. Nice job all around.
        <cite>Steve P.</cite> <div class="c"></div>

      <blockquote>Very satisfied with the professionalism, expertise, honesty and thoroughness demonstrated by Leslie Stark during the sale of our home and purchase of new residence. We highly recommend using Leslie as your Realtor.

      <blockquote>This is the 7th time we have purchased a home and our experience was the best ever, thanks to Leslie. We live in St . Louis, MO and we made a several trips to Gold Canyon to look at houses. Leslie worked with us and guided us thru the process. She knows the area very well and is very professional in all aspects. Thanks to Leslie, we found our retirement home and we love it.

      <blockquote>Leslie guided me with knowledge and caring during the buying and selling of my homes in the area in the past month. I felt Leslie treated me as though I had a million dollar property rather than one of much lesser value. She was in constant touch, answered all questions immediately and got all information to me immediately. She was very professional and thorough. My home sold in ten days I felt due to her open houses and advertising. She did her homework during all phases of the two transactions. I will recommend Leslie to everyone as an excellent caring realtor.
